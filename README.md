# A1-fullstack-backend
Spring Boot / Postman / MySQL / IntelliJ IDEA

This project aims to develop a full-stack web application for managing user information using React , Spring Boot, and MySQL. The frontend will be built using React for the user interface, while the backend will be developed using Spring Boot to create RESTful APIs for handling CRUD operations. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) will serve as the primary IDE for frontend development and Axios will be used for making HTTP requests to the backend APIs. Postman will be utilized for testing the backend APIs, with development primarily done in IntelliJ IDEA..
